# Notes on kernel installation 
  To install multiple kernels
  from multiple conda environment
  so that they are visible 
  from another environment, in the jupyter notebook,
  I followed successfully
  these instructions for Python:
  https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html
 
  And these instructions for R:
  https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel

  For R, there are issues.
  I've created a R conda environment first,
  but it may not be needed.
  It may be better to try other ways,
  where one has more control over the installation.
